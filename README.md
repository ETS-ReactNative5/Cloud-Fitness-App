# Cloud-Fitness-App

## Description of the App
### Purpose:
The purpose of this assessment is to design a web application for a commercial client. For this assessment we are creating a web application for a gym. Our gym app is called Cloud Fitness and it will store the information of the gym members, help them book gym sessions and select their chosen workout routines. 

We created the gym web app for a variety of reasons:
According to the New Daily,56% of Australians are inactive or don't get enough exercise, increasing their risk of cancer, weight gain and type 2 diabetes. Therefore, going to the gym is a very important part of a person's life as it helps to:
- Increase your body's physical activity
- Relieve stress
- Improve your sleep
- Improve your social life by creating friends at the gym.

Cloud Fitness attempts to make this easier for Australians by enabling them to register, book gym sessions and select workout routines.


### Functionality
- Register for a gym account with your full name, Date of birth, email, phone number, Billing information and Physical profile(Height, weight, gender, level of fitness etc)
- Once logged in, you can book and delete a gym session
- Once you have selected a gym session, you can select a chosen workout routine. Each gym member chooses:
    - GOALS: flex & relax, aerobic, strength
    - LEVELS: developed, intermediate, advanced.
    - PEOPLE: single, couple, families, groups(maximum 8 people)
    - TIME 20, 30, 40 or 50 minutes.
- The gym users will then be directed to a Payment Gateway, where they can pay their gym sessions easily.
- After the gym session is completed, a feedback poll will pop-up to analyse results and generate statistics.

### Tech Stack
For this web app, we will be using MERN, SASS and Heroku.
MERN stands for MongoDB Express.JS React.JS Node.JS
- MongoDB: An open source database management system that uses a document-oriented database model which supports various forms of data.

- Express.JS: A minimal and flexible Node.js web app framework that provides a set of features for web applications.

- React.JS: A javascript library for building user interfaces. React is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.

- Node.JS: An open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser.

- SASS is our CSS framework for our web app. It is the most stable and powerful professional grade CSS extension language in the world.

- Heroku is our deployment platform for our web app. Heroku is a cloud platform as a service supporting several programming languages.

### Target Audience
The ideal customer for Cloud Fitness is a 18-35 years old individual, living or working within five miles of one of our gym clubs. That also believe fitness is important to health and a great way to make friends and spend time with them.

Market segmentation:
According to the econ gym, 50% of their customers were aged between 24-35. These customers were finished with school and were able to afford gym. They had the time and money.

30% of their customers were aged between 18-20. These customers were mainly still in school. They had the time to come to the gym regularly. They also have school breaks during the summer holidays in which they can spend more time at the gym, thus creating an increase in customers during the months of November to February.

20% of their customers were above 35 years old. This was their smallest market segmentation because people 35+ have a job and a family and as people get older, they tend to lose their motivation to attend gym regularly. Through the development of our gym web app, we hope to improve this statistic.

### Planning Methodology
Through meetings we have decided on the use of Trello to plan and manage our Product.  We have agreed to use Github for code management and heroku for deployment.  We are using Slack for commmunication and sharing of diagrams.  We have agreed to being on site Monday to Wednesday and offsite at our times.

When creating our Trello board, we all worked together to create the cards. Each card shows the level of work or difficulty. Every card is clearly marked with the team member or members who worked on it.  Each team member should move the cards on the trello board to reflect where they are at with that piece of work.

We have made cards in Trello that help us to divide on the work.  At the moment what areas we work on, are determined by the team.  We agree to working on feature branches and 1 or 2 members to do code reviews and the person who creates the branch, merges the branch into master. We agree to regular commits when working on code. Should conflicts arise the parties with conflicting code should work together or be in agreement what code to accept and merge.

We agreeed to daily stand ups on Monday to Wednesday and regularly communication on trello when working off site. As a team we make request for other meetings as deemed necessary.

At our meeting with the client we agreed to emailing and other communications or meetings agreed through email.  We sent through wireframes of our design for the website and asked further input from the client on design.  The Client will sign off on the design and we will notify the client regarding our first and subsequent deployments for heroku during the project so that can see progress and give feedback.
