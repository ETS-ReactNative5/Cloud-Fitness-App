        <h3 class="values-title"><em>Achievement</em></h3>
        <p>We often judge ourselves most harshly.  The challenge is to be kinder to yourself.
            Ask youreself, are you making headway/steps towards your goals across all spheres of life?
            Acknowledge your progress, no matter how small, or significant, in little ways that bring
            you happiness (non food). Politely acknowledge and hear the kind words of others, for they 
            are not given lightly. So listen and believe in what others see in you. See something in their
            words. Try to see it in yourself, even if it's just a little. Think of fun ways you can 
            acknowledge and recognise to yourself your progress.<br><br></p>
        <h3 class="values-title-3">Self Care</em></h3>
        <p class="container">Raelee.Design believes in Self Care. A quote from Maxine Horne and the Title
            a book written by Madoona King, <em>"Think Smart, Run Hard"</em>. We believe, <em><i>run hard,</i></em>
            but think <em><i>smart</i></em>. Ensure you give back to yourself. We believe in "Living your Optimal Day", everyday. Little things 
            you can incorporate in your day to recharge your battery. Raelee.Design encourages, good sleep, 
            7-8 hours, every night, exercise (you enjoy), meditation, a "No Screen", outdoor if possible, 
            30-45 minute lunch. Enjoy the outdoors in a shaded spot, enjoy the coming and goings of life. 
            Read a professional development book. Wind down before bed, mentally unpack your day, prepare 
            for the next. This then, leads to restful sleep when you empty your mind of worries. Love what 
            you do. Live your values. Encourage and inspire others and add value, in Business and in life.</p>
